    "### 1. Set 1 - Simple Thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thresholding** is a technique in OpenCV, which is the assignment of pixel values in relation to the threshold value provided. In thresholding, each pixel value is compared with the threshold value. If the pixel value is smaller than the threshold, it is set to 0, otherwise, it is set to a maximum value (generally 255). Thresholding is a very popular segmentation technique, used for separating an object considered as a foreground from its background. A threshold is a value which has two regions on its either side i.e. below the threshold or above the threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "> In Computer Vision, this technique of thresholding is done on grayscale images. So initially, the image **must be converted in grayscale color space.**\n",
    "\n",

    "* cv.THRESH_TRUNC - If pixel intensity value is greater than threshold, it is truncated to the threshold. The pixel values are set to be the same as the threshold. All other values remain the same.\n",

    "\n",
    "Another Thresholding technique is **Adaptive Thresholding**. In Simple Thresholding, a global value of threshold was used which remained constant throughout. So, a constant threshold value won’t help in the case of variable lighting conditions in different areas. Adaptive thresholding is the method where the threshold value is calculated for smaller regions. This leads to different threshold values for different regions with respect to the change in lighting. We use `cv2.adaptiveThreshold()` for this.\n",
